    question: "Can clients save files before paying?",
    answer:
      "No, clients cannot save files before they have paid for them. The platform creates watermark protected previews of your files for clients to enlarge and appreciate the details, but right-clicking or downloading these is disabled to stop people from getting the pictures for free. Clients only get the high-quality, watermark free files after they complete payment.",

  {
    question: "Does the platform maintain the original quality of my files?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the platform keeps your files in their original, high quality. It displays preview images for your clients to see before they make payment. After they pay the price you've set, they can download the full-quality pictures.",

    question: "Can my clients contact me?",
